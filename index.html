        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
         <p>The purpose of this project is to develop a file storage server for a web application titled "Recipehub" (see project overview section for more information).
          This file server routinely performs backups of large image files in order to accomodate for new versions of Recipehub (incase previous versions must be restored)
          and logs memory consumption as each iteration of this project grows substantially (backups of these files are only available for 30 days before they are removed).
          It is important to keep track of how much storage the project files consume- this information can be found after running log scripts found in the project directory located in /var/www/html.  
          The files for this project are backed up and hosted on Google Cloud Virtual Machine.</p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>Recipehub is super simple to use and free. As long as you have a working knowledge of web browsers and webpage navigation, 
            then this application is for you. No log in necessary. This application is only supported on desktop and requires an internet connection to access.

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This service is a recipe and food tracking application that enables users to access
          a variety of easy to use and helpful tools via the webpage.
          These tools include: 
            <li>A favorites page to create bookmarks that link to external recipe websites. These bookmarks are saveable and deletable.</li>  
            <li>A personal recipes page that allows users to create recipes and download the text files for them on to their personal computer.</li> 
            <li>A premade recipes page that enables users to search from over 40,000 different recipes (as well as access premade grocery lists and utilites).</li>
            <li>A grocery list page that allows users to make simple grocery lists as well as search for grocery stores near them.</li>
            <li>A meal tracker page that allows users to track meals throughout the day, week, or month.</li>

            <ul>This web application is hosted on Google Cloud Virtual Machine. </ul>

# Project-report-page-

This is a simple report page I developed to host on a Linux server using PHP and can be reached via an external IP address linked to my virtual machine. 
The report page details an external web application developed as a project for one of my courses and includes screenshots, links, and references. 

The UI uses HTML, CSS, and JS.
